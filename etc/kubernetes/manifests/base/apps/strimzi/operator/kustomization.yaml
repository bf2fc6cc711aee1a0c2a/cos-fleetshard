patches:
  # the Strimzi-cluster-operator yaml is a convenient way to install the
  # operator, so it includes everything that is needed including the CRDs
  # however in our case, CRD and operators should be kept separated as we
  # want to get the latest CRDs, but we can have a number of operators
  # installed side by side

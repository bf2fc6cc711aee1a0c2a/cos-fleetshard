  # the strimzi-cluster-operator yaml is an convenient way to install the
  # operator so it includes everithing that is needed including the CRDs
  # however in our case, CRD and operators shoud be kept separated as we
  # want to get the latest CRDs but we can have a number of operators
  # installed side by side

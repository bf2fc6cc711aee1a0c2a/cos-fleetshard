## Reporting an issue

This project uses GitHub issues to manage the issues. Open an issue directly in GitHub. you can also open JIRA issues at https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGDCTRS

If you believe you found a bug, and it's likely possible, please indicate a way to reproduce it, what you are seeing and what you would expect to see.

## Before you contribute

To contribute, use GitHub Pull Requests, from your **own** fork.

Also, make sure you have set up your Git authorship correctly:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

If you use different computers to contribute, please make sure the name is the same on all your computers.

We use this information to acknowledge your contributions in release announcements.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, need to be reviewed by a cos-fleetshard committers before being merged.

[GitHub Pull Request Review Process](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) is followed for every pull request.

### Coding Guidelines

 * We decided to disallow `@author` tags in the Javadoc: they are hard to maintain
 * Commits should be atomic and semantic. Please properly squash your pull requests before submitting them. Fixup commits can be used temporarily during the review process but things should be squashed at the end to have meaningful commits.
 We use merge commits so the GitHub Merge button cannot do that for us. If you don't know how to do that, just ask in your pull request, we will be happy to help!

### Continuous Integration

 cos-fleetshard project CI is based on GitHub Actions, which means that everyone has the ability to automatically execute CI in their forks as part of the process of making changes. We ask that all non-trivial changes go through this process, so that the contributor gets immediate feedback, while at the same time keeping our CI fast and healthy for everyone.

### Tests and documentation are not optional

Don't forget to include tests in your pull requests.
Also don't forget the documentation (reference documentation, javadoc...).

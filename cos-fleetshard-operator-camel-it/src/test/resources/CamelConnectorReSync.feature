Feature: Camel Connector ReSync

  Background:
    Given Await configuration
      | atMost       | 5000    |
      | pollDelay    | 100     |
      | pollInterval | 500     |

  Scenario: klb becomes ready
    Given a Connector with:
      | connector.type.id           | log_sink_0.1                    |
      | desired.state               | ready                           |
      | kafka.bootstrap             | kafka.acme.com:443              |
      | operator.id                 | cos-fleetshard-operator-camel   |
      | operator.type               | camel-connector-operator        |
      | operator.version            | [1.0.0,2.0.0)                   |
    And with sample camel connector

    When deploy
    Then the connector exists
    Then the connector secret exists
    Then the klb exists
    Then the klb secret exists

    When the klb phase is "Ready" with conditions:
      | message   | reason   | status     | type     | lastTransitionTime        |
      | a message | a reason | True       | Ready    | 2021-06-12T12:35:09+02:00 |
    Then the connector is in phase "Monitor"
     And the deployment is in phase "ready"

    When deploy
    Then wait till the connector has entry in history with phase "Augmentation" and conditions:
      | type         | status | reason    |
      | Resync       | True   | Resync    |
      | Augmentation | True   | Resync    |
      | Ready        | False  | Resync    |
     And wait till the connector has entry in history with phase "Monitor" and conditions:
      | type         | status | reason            |
      | Resync       | False  | Resync            |
      | Augmentation | True   | Augmentation      |

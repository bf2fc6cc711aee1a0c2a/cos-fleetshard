Feature: Camel Connector Lifecycle

  Background:
    Given Await configuration
      | atMost       | 30000   |
      | pollDelay    | 100     |
      | pollInterval | 500     |

  Scenario: stop
    Given a Connector with:
      | connector.type.id           | log_sink_0.1                    |
      | desired.state               | ready                           |
      | kafka.bootstrap             | kafka.acme.com:443              |
      | operator.id                 | cos-fleetshard-operator-camel   |
      | operator.type               | camel-connector-operator        |
      | operator.version            | [1.0.0,2.0.0)                   |
    And with sample camel connector

    When deploy
    Then the connector exists
    Then the connector secret exists
    Then the klb exists
    Then the klb secret exists

    When the connector desired status is set to "stopped"
    Then the connector is in phase "Stopped"

  Scenario: delete
    Given a Connector with:
      | connector.type.id           | log_sink_0.1                    |
      | desired.state               | ready                           |
      | kafka.bootstrap             | kafka.acme.com:443              |
      | operator.id                 | cos-fleetshard-operator-camel   |
      | operator.type               | camel-connector-operator        |
      | operator.version            | [1.0.0,2.0.0)                   |
    And with sample camel connector

    When deploy
    Then the connector exists
    Then the connector secret exists
    Then the klb exists
    Then the klb secret exists

    When the connector desired status is set to "deleted"
    Then the connector is in phase "Deleted"
    Then the connector secret exists
    Then the klb does not exists
    Then the klb secret does not exists
